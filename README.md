## 📝 Instructions

1. Begin with a copy of the CodeSandbox you used for **ALAB 316.1.1 - DOM Manipulation (Part One)**.
2. Fork that CodeSandbox and rename it to indicate that this is **Part Two** of the lab.
3. **Do not modify** any of the contents of the `index.html` or `styles.css` files.
4. Your goal in this lab is to demonstrate DOM manipulation through **JavaScript**, so directly modifying the HTML or CSS files is counterproductive.
